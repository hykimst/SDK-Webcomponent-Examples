[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/hyk-matterport/web-component-examples)

**NOTE**

In Terminal, run `npm run build`
- yarn install: This command installs all the project's dependencies listed in the package.json file. If you're using npm, the equivalent would be npm install. 
- tsc: This command runs the TypeScript compiler (tsc). It takes your TypeScript code (.ts or .tsx files) and compiles it into JavaScript code (.js files) that browsers can understand.
- vite build: This command runs the Vite build process. Vite is a build tool that optimizes and bundles your code for production. It performs tasks like: minifying code, bundling JS, CSS, and other files generating production-ready build for your app in the /dist directory.
Then, it will run `postinstall`
- yarn matterport-assets public/assets: which install Matterport assets in the `public/assets` folder.

At last run `npm run dev` which will start the project.
